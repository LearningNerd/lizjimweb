  <h3>Iterative Development</h3>
  <p>

    - Work collaboratively with a decision-maker
    - No suprises or grand reveals at the end of the project

    - Decision-makers are present when problems arise or needed features are discovered
    that change the trajectory of the project, and are involved in deciding to what
    to do.

    This kind of collaboration results in a better product, and happier team-mates.
